# Chinese remainder theorem

The theorem states that if one knows the remainders of the Euclidean division of an integer $n$ by several integers,

$$\begin{cases} x \equiv r \mod a \\ ... \\ x \equiv s \mod b\end{cases} $$

then one can determine uniquely the remainder of the division of $n$, if the divisors ($a$, $b$, ...)  are pairwise **coprime**.

```haskell
import Math.NumberTheory.Moduli (chineseRemainder)

chineseRemainder :: [(Integer, Integer)] -> Maybe Integer
```
