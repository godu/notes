# Functor

> In category theory, a functor is a map between categories.

The mapping :

- associates to each object $X$ in $C$ an object $F(X)$ in $D$
- associates to each morphism $f:X \to Y$ in $C$ a morphism $F(f):F(X) \to F(Y)$ in $D$ such that the following tho conditions hold:
  - $F(id_x) = id_{F(X)}$ for every object $X$ in $C$
  - $F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ F(f)$ for all morphisms: $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to Z$ in $C$
