# The Napoleon Technique

The Napoleon technique is a productivity technique that involves postponing dealing with something, if there is a good chance that it will get properly resolved without your immediate input.

This technique is based on Napoleon’s habit of waiting for three weeks before opening letters, unless it was clear that they were truly urgent.

The main benefit of this technique is that it allows you to conserve resources, such as your time and energy, by helping you filter out things that don’t truly require you to expend these resources; in addition, this technique can also help you in other ways, such as by teaching people to be more thoughtful when asking you for help.

## When

When deciding whether to implement this technique, consider the potential positive and negative outcomes of postponement, and how likely they are to occur.

## How

When using this technique, make sure that it’s truly beneficial for you to do so, and that you’re not just using it as an excuse to procrastinate or avoid dealing with information that you don’t want to handle.

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- The ostrich effect: a cognitive bias that cause people to avoid situations where they might encounter information that they perceive as negative.

- Procrastination: the act of unnecessarily postponing decisions or actions.

- Parkinson's law: the adage that "work expends so as to fill the time which is available for its completion".
