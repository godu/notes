# Least recently used (LRU)

[[[c60a0582]]]

LRU keeps the most recently used data and discard the least recently used.

## Naive implementation

 ```haskell
 data LRU key val = LRU
            { maxSize :: Integer
            , contents :: Map key val
            , usages :: List key
            }
```

In addition to keep cached values, we need to track age of keys.

## Example

```
LRU 3 {} []
```

Miss `1`, `2` and `3`

```
LRU 3 {1, 2, 3} [3, 2, 1]
```

Hit `2`

```
LRU 3 {1, 2, 3} [2, 3, 1]
```

Miss `4`

```
LRU 3 {2, 3, 4} [4, 2, 3]
```
