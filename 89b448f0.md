# Newtype

## Description

Lightweight data wrapper.

## When to use

When using the same primitive type (`Int`, `Text`, etc.) to represent semantically different entities (name, title, description, etc.).

## Benefits

1. Improves maintainability
2. Increases code readability.
3. Allows reusing instance definitions with [[[fa7e0b0a]]]

## Costs

1. Additional wrapping and unwrapping.


## Definition

You can define a data type as `newtype`  instead of `data` only if it has **exactly** one constructor with **exactly** one field.

```haskell
newtype Volume = Volume Double

newtype Side = Side
    { unSide :: Int
    }
```

## Safer interface and performance

`newtype` is a **zero-cost** abstraction.

You can provide a safer interface to your API without sacrificing performance.

```haskell

validateHash :: ByteString -> ByteString -> Bool

-- 

newtype Password = Password ByteString
newtype PasswordHash = PasswordHash ByteString

validateHash :: Password -> PasswordHash -> Bool
```

Now, `validateHash hash password` is a **compile-time error**, and it makes it impossible to confuse the order of arguments.

## Alternative

Another popular way of increasing code readability without sacrificing performance is introducing a new alias by using the `type` keyword. Unfortunately, this approach is only a partial solution. The compiler doesn't see the difference between type alias and type itself.

```haskell
type Attack  = Int
type Defense = Int

calculateDamage :: Attack -> Defense -> Attach

-- similar to 

calculateDamage :: Int -> Int -> Int
```

You can write 

```haskell
calculate monsterDefense playerAttack
```

without get a compile-time error and get a runtime bug.
