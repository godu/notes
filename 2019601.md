Z3 is a [Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories) solver developed by Microsoft

## Conjecture

### Definition

A conjecture is a proposition that suspected to be true but for which no proof or disproof has yet been found.

### Examples

#### [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem)

There're no three positive integers `a`, `b` and `c`, can satisfy the equation

```mathjax
a^n + b^n = c^n
```

for any integer value of `n` greater than two.

#### [Four color theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem)

> The regions of any simple planar map can be colored with only four colors, in such a waythat any two adjacent regions have different colors.

### Sample

```smt
(declare-const p Bool)
(declare-const q Bool)
(declare-const r Bool)
(define-fun conjecture () Bool
	(=> (and (=> p q) (=> q r))
		(=> p r)))
(assert (not conjecture))
(check-sat)
```

```haskell
import Data.SBV

_ = sat $ do
  p <- sBool "p"
  q <- sBool "q"
  r <- sBool "r"

  let conjecture = ((p .=> q) .&& (q .=> r)) .=> (p .=> r)
  constrain $ sNot conjecture
```
