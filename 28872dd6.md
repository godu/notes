# Let binding

## Definition

> A binding associates an identifier with a value or function.

Given a name to an expression.

## Modern programming languages

```fsharp
// F#
let pi = 3.14
```

In some language as OCaml or Haskell, `let express` is write as :

```ocaml
(* OCaml *)
let pi = 3.14 in
pi
```

`Let binding` is use to extend the current scope with expressions as a new local scope.

```haskell
-- Haskell
-- global scope
let pi = 3.14 in
-- first local scope
let pi = 3.1415 in
-- second local scope
pi
```

*Some language use `let expression` syntax without follow the right behavior.*

```js
// Javascript
let pi = 3.14;
let pi = 3.1415; // SyntaxError: redeclaration of let pi
```

## Λ-calculus

Λ-calculus use application to bind expression to variable.

```
# λ-calculus
(λpi.pi)(3.14)
```

[Dana Scott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Scott)’s [LCF language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_expression#History) introduce `let expression` in 1977 as an evolution of λ-calculus into modern functional languages.

## Alternative

Haskell provide an alternative way to bind expression :

```haskell
-- Haskell
area r = r^2 * pi
  where
    pi = 3.13
```
