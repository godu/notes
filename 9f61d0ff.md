# 2Q algorithm

[[c60a0582]]

Instead of [[c402598f.md]] that consideres most recently used pages, 2Q algorithm focus on most **frequency** used.

- $AlIn$ is a [[c60a0582]] buffer that retain newly referenced pages.
- $AlOut$  is a [[c60a0582]] buffer that is used to detect pages that have high long-term access rates.
- $Am$  is then main [[c60a0582]] buffer that store long-term pages.
