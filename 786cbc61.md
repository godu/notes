# [hie-bios](https://github.com/mpickering/hie-bios)

`hie-bios` is a way to setup [`haskell-language-server`](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server).

- List your components

```bash
$ stack ide targets
my-project:lib
my-project:exe:my-project-exec
my-project:test:my-project-test
```

- `hie.yaml` :

```yaml
cradle:
  stack:
    stackYaml: "stack.yaml"
    components:
      - path: "./app"
        component: "my-project:exe:my-project-exec"
      - path: "./src"
        component: "my-project:lib"
      - path: "./test"
        component: "my-project:test:my-project-test"
```
