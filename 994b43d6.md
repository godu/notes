# Evidence

This topic completes the pattern of [[[42c1547a]]].

## Description

Replacing boolean blindness with the validation witness.

## When to use

1. When you want to make sure that data is validated or you want to reuse that knowledge in the future.
2. To make illegal states unrepresentable.

## Benefits

1. More robust code.
2. Better maintainablility.
3. More context in data.
4. Better error-messages support.

## Costs

1. Writes code in a slightly different way.
2. More code.

## Usage

```haskell
sort :: Org a => [a] -> [a]
```

By sorting a list, we gained a knowledge that now all elements in the list are in the increasing order. But the type of a sorted list is the same os the type of any other list.

This problem can be solved. We are going to follow [[[89b448f0]]] and [[[42c1547a]]] patterns.

```haskell 
newtype SortedList a = SortedList [a]

sort :: Ord a => [a] -> SortedList a
```
