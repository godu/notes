# Bloom filter

A Bloom filter is a method of representing a set $A = a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ to support membership queries.

It is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to answer a very simple question : **is this element a member of a set?** A Bloom filter does not store the actual elements, it only stores the **membership** of them. **Items cannot be removed from the Bloom Filter**.

Possibles answers :

- False positive : *possibly in set*
- True negative : *definitely not in set*

It trades space and performance for accuracy.

## Examples

They can be placed on top of a datastore. When a key is queried for its existence and the filter does not have it, we can skip querying the datastore entirely.

## How does it work

1. Allocate an array $v$ of $m$ bits, each initialized to $0$.
2. Pick $k$ independent hash functions $h_1, h_2, ..., h_k$, each with range $1, ..., m$.

### Insertion

When an element $a \in A$ is added to the filter, the bits at positions $h_1(a), h_2(a), ..., h_k(a)$ in $v$ are set to $1$.

### Query

To query the membership of an element $b$, we check the bits at indices $h_1(b), h_2(b), ..., h_k(b)$ in $v$. If any of them is $0$, then certainly $b$ in not int the set $A$. Otherwise, we assume that $b$ is in the set although it's possible that some other element or group of elements hashed the same indices.

We can target a specific probability of false positives by selecting a optimal value of $m$ and $k$ for up to $n$ insertions.

A Bloom filter eventually reaches a point where all bits are set, which means every query will indicate membership, effectively making the probability of false positives 1. The problem with this is it requires a priori knowledge of the data set in order to select optimal parameters and avoir overfilling.

### Finding optimal $k$ and $m$

We can derive optimal $k$ and $m$ and a chosen probability of false positives $P_FP$.

$$k=-\frac{ln P_FP}{ln 2}$$

$$m=-\frac{n ln P_FP}{(ln 2)^2}$$
