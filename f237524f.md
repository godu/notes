# `fold`

The recursion operator `fold` encapsulates a common pattern for defining programs that consume values of a least fixpoint type such as finite lists.

## Simple implementation

```haskell
fold :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
```

Some examples :

```haskell
sum :: [Int] -> Int
sum = fold (+) 0

product :: [Int] -> Int
product = fold (*) 1

and :: [Bool] -> Bool
and = fold (&&) True

or :: [Bool] -> Bool
or = fold (||) False

compose :: [a -> a] -> (a -> a)
compose = fold (.) id
```

## Advanced implementation

```haskell
data Fold a b = forall m. Monoid m => Fold (a -> m) (m -> b)

fold :: Fold a b -> [a] -> b
fold (Fold tally summarize) = summarize . mconcat . fmap tally
```

`Fold` derives `Functor` `Applicative`, `Monoid`, `Num`...
