# Phantom type parameters

## Description

Additional type-level information available during compile-time by introducing extra type variables.

## When to use

1. To avoid duplication of many similar data types.
2. To increase code type-safety.

## Benefits

1. More compile-time guarantees.
2. Better ergonomics compared to code duplication.
3. Flexibility.
4. Extensibility.

## Costs

1. Need to know when not to use it. Can get out of control when applied to unsuitable situations.
2. Less beginner-friendly.

## Usage

You can exploit them to distinguish usages of the same `newtype` for different purposes. Instead of writing:

```haskell
newtype Id = Id
    { unId :: Int
    }

isCommentByUser :: Id -> Id -> Bool
```

or more verbose

```haskell
newtype UserId    = UserId    Int
newtype CommentId = CommentId Int

isCommentByUser :: UserId -> CommentId -> Bool
```

you can have one newtype to represent that all:

```haskell
newtype Id a = Id Int

isCommentByUser :: Id User -> Id Comment -> Bool
isCommentByUser x y = error ""
```
