# Smart constructor

## Description

Providing idiomatic ways for constructing values.

## When to use

1. When a data type restricts some values.
2. When you want to make construction of big data types easier.
3. To avoir runtime errors.
4. To make illegal states unrepresentable.

## Benefits

1. More structured and maintainable code.
2. Separation of concepts.
3. Control of erroneous data inputs.

## Costs

1. Inability to define instances outside of the modules.

## Usage

Once you have a [[[89b448f0]]], you want to avoid providing unsafe ways of constructing values without validation.

```haskell
module Password
    ( Password
    , unPassword
    , mkPassword
    ) where

import Data.ByteString (ByteString)
import qualified Data.ByteString as ByteString

newtype Password = Password ByteString

unPassword :: Password -> ByteString
unPassword (Password password) = password

-- | Smart contrucotr. Doesn't allow empty passwords.
mkPassword :: ByteString -> Maybe Password
mkPassword password
    | ByteString.null password = Nothing
    | otherwise = Just (Password password)
```

It is important to hide the constructor to forbid value coercion.

## Variations

- Replacing `Maybe` with `Either` of `Validation`
- Rename the constructor to `UnsafePassword` instead of having a separate `unsagePassword` function. (less safer approach due to coercions).
- Validation of the statically-known values during compile-time, so you get errors in compile-time instead of runtime, and you don't need unsafe functions when you know that the values are valid.
