# Lambda DAYS 2021

## Industry versus academia ? Learning and teaching programming

University : Learn to learn
Industry : Learn to do stuff

FP paradigm could be proof


First notions to teach
- pattern matching
- recursion


top-down vs bottom-up ???

Asynchronous teaching

How to convince our university to teach FP ?
concurrency programming is the future => functionnal programming
FP principals are useful in many other languages.

## Toward Automated Feedback in HtDP-based Programming: A DSL-based Approach

How to Design Programs

1. Data definition & examples
2. Purpose, signature, header
3. Input-output examples
4. Function template
5. Function definition
6. Testing

## Factorio

Ingredient → type
Assembler → function

Assembler consume ingredient.
Linear function consume data too.

High order function
Currying

fmap Functor
Either/tuple
merge operator → Monoidal functor
applicative functor
Monad ? nope

Mutex with train. dead locks


## Writing good programs in functional languages: who, why, how ?

- Names matter a lot
- Structure matters: encapsulation good, spaghetti bad
- Types are a double-edged, very sharp sword

- Requirements change, like it or not
- Debugging is hard and best avoided
- Testing, early, helps

> You can argue FP is a success (FP features in Java)

> A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not the ......

Cleverness problem. ↑ clever  ↓ debugging

## Introduction Nx

Erlang lib

- Multi-dimensional typed array (aka tensors)
- Numerical definitions
- Automatic differentiation
- JIT/AOT staged compilation to the CPU/GPU

Exemple: Live-code a neural network from scratch



## Constructive Bidirectional Programming

catamorphism + catamorphism

profunctor => lens, et c’est par design. l’oplog mongo envoi juste une instruction de détruire doc dans collectoin ay

Huge DB ------> View 
    ↑---update---/

We could modify data in view and the mutation is propaged to db

### Get-based Approach

```
put s (get s) = s
```
Modify the getted value

### Putback-based Approach


```
get (put s t) = t
```
Emit mutation transformation and wait to get new value.

1 put => 1 get
to make sure data is synchr with source

Challenges 
- bfold
- fusion property
- map fusion
- Scan Lemma ???
- Hornor's rule ???


bidirectionnal fold => bforld

Contract Lens :: {
    contract source => cs
    contract view => cv

    get
    put
}

## Effective Programming in OCaml

Multicore OCaml project

Use generator to implement effect handlers

```ocaml
effect E : string

let comp () =
    print_string "0 ";  
    print_string (perform E);  
    print_string "3 "

let main () = 
    try
        comp ()
    with effect E k ->
        print_string "1 ";
        continue k "2 ";
        print_string “4 "
```

## Location Type Errors Speedily with Delta Debugging

Rien compris

## Program Equivalence in Sequential Core Erlang

```
e === (() => e)()
a + 1 + 1 === a + 2
f(a, b) === f(a, b)
```

Try to detect equivalent expressions and factorise it.

Side effects / exceptions are not supported.

## Hardware as Software

FPGA or ASIC
programmable board as a service

Memory management
- D flip-flop (DFF)
- state management => FSM

Reactive time-varying spatial "program"
=> Streams, Reactive Programming

Combinational logic - Spatial
Sequential logic with clocked state update - Temporal

## Excel meets Lambda

We could define and use lambda in excel

**Turing complet** because `Fixed point combinator`, that he said.


no var but LET function

## A generic back-end for exploratory programming

Whatever...

## Fast XML/HTML for Haskell: XML TypeLift

Generic parsers:
- expat (fast xml c parser)
- DOM (memory problem) vs SAX (stream processing)
- asmxml (32-bit only)
- pugixml (replaces text with pointers in-place)
- FPGA accelerators for xml parsing

Haskell solution
- xeno: A fast, low-memory use, event-based XML parser in pure Haskell.

## Correct-by-Construction Cryptographic Arithmetic in Coq

Use Coq to generate optimized code from input parameters.


## Generating Programs from Type

Search function from type in Hoogles

- [Synquid](http://comcom.csail.mit.edu/comcom/#Synquid): synthesizes programs from refinement types
- [Hoogle+](https://hoogleplus.goto.ucsd.edu/)

## Dynamic Creation of Well-Typed DSL Expressions

ADT is often not good enough for a DSL (type errors, unsafe variables)

works for phantom types, GADTs and functions
guarantee well-typed.

## Asynchronous Shared Data Sources

Data sources:
- memory, fs
- stream
- kafka, mysql, mqtt, hadoop

- Read
- Write
- Update
- Lens
- Fuse ???
- ...
- Notify
- Share

=> Shared Data Sources (SDSs)

**Task Oriented Programming (TOP)**
- Coordinate collaboration between people and machines to reach common goal
- Declarative paradigm
- iTasks: event driven state transformers

Programmer's interaction with shares:
- get/watch
- set
- update

History
- Uniform Data Sources
- Shared Data Sources
- Parametrec Lenses
- Parametric Shared Data Sources
- Class based Shared Data Sources
- Asynchronous Shared Data Sources

Provide uniformed interface to manipulate data sources.

## Adventures in the browser and Node.js without writing (much) JavaScript (using PureScript)

- Transpiles to JS
- ADT (no GADT)
- HKT
- TypeClasses
- Rebindable syntax
- Functional dependencies
- Row polymorphism
- Extensible records & variants
- No language pragmas & modern Prelude

Bi-directional parsing (encoding<->decoding) (like io-ts)
=> purescript-argonaut

Operators:
- First
- Next
- FBY: follow by
- ASA: as soon as

## A "UML" equivalent for functional programming

Philosophy → Meaning ↔ Program

- Underlying philosophy must be **invariant** -- gives a shared perspective to practitioners
- Meaning is build on underlying philosophy
- Meaning can evolve along with program/system

UML's "Theory of Forms" philosophy won't work!

Language-games (Wittgenstein)
-> Programming isn't natural language

A Language of Functional Programming = Language of Mathematics + Language Game
