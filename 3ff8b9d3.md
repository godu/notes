# No Deadlines approach

- Build products without announcing them in advance.
- Let the marketing teams promote work that is already done.

Actively share your progress:

- ticket burn-down charts
- a clear view of remaining work, progress, pace and remaining scope

If your team feels time pressure to work overtime before some drop-dead deadline:

- the engineering managers are reporting to the wrong people
- the team lacks a string engineering leader who understands the futility of software estimates and the need for a collaborative give-and-take between engineering and product in order to ensure the flexibility of shipping scaled-back MVP's to hit delivery targets
