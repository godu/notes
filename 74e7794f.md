# Management Theory

## Financial Management

> Liquidation Manager to govern Liquid Value.

It was formed in order to optimize the transformation of one form of value (coin/gold/cash) into another form of value (tangible and intangible assets).

### Purpose

> Manage Liquidity.

### Practices

Conserve, develop and exploit cash.

> Investments or loans.

Return-in-investment (RIO) oriented.

### Motivate effectiveness

Small stake in any higher than expected returns achieved and a small piece of cash efficiencies achieved.

> Financial targets with corresponding bonuses.

## Business Management

> Replication Management to govern Replicated Value

#### Problems that solved

- Incentives were wrong : Workers was paid for the day without considered productivity.
- Work practices were wrong : Don't care about effectiveness.
- Management was clueless : Managers never learned to do the actual work.

### Fredric Taylor's Scientific Management

> Scalable management system

Leverages time and motion studies to establish best practices for all workstations.

Factory output and time-to-delivery of an order could be calculated.

Work practices + uniform materials + known recipes / designs
â‡’ reliable master planning.

### Purpose

> Replicate known value and known recipes, using best practices, elimination of waste, and high-quality predictive planning.

### Motivate effectiveness

Date driven according to expectations set with the customer during the sales process.

- Staff : provide a bonus for achieving or surpassing reasonable production goals.
- Management : incentives to help staff achieve their time-boxed goals.

## Creative Management

> Create Management to govern discovery of New Value

Establish a system of management that enables and motivates creative staff to discover and realize new works of value.

### Purpose

Find previously unknown recipes (unknown value) and transmute it into discovered value - new recipes and new ingredients.

### Creative system principles

- You learn by failing, and new value comes from a critical mass of new learning
- So, fail often, fail quickly, but fail smartly (failure without learning is waste)
- Build platforms, practices and cultures that help people discover value
- Relentlessly discover new value, even when the odds are against it
- Empower your creative staff to transform the world by solving meaningful problems

### Strong attractors and shared conception

Maintain creative motivation

- Need : something that's missing from life
- Belief : belief it can be created
- Opportunity : a career opportunity to create that thing
- Anticipation : shared anticipation of the better future

> Continuously communicating to them the "why?".

### Advises

#### Our goal must be to get the cost of failure down, and the rate of learning up

Small teams and small value attempts

#### Team composition

Yours teams need to have the research, promotion and analysis skills that are needed to rapidly discover, test and learn.

#### Automation

Invest in platforms and tools that speed your team's ability to make value attemps.

#### Drive to value, drive to date

Don't fate value discovery by setting arbitrary release dates.

#### Motivating the team

Shared conception using strong attractors.

## Types of value

- Undiscovered
- Discovered
- Replicated
- Liquidated

## The value fulfillment cycle

> Cash Investment -> Discover Value -> Replicate Value -> Cash-out Value

Department-oriented thinking have the effect of slowing down realization of value by serializing the discovery of value, discovery of chaos and discovery of customers.

### Healthy companies are a combination of the three

Every exceptional restaurant has

- an executive chef to do the creative work
- hosts, waiters, porters and line chefs to do the replication work
- an accountant to effectively cashflow the enterprise
