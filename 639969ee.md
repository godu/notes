# Bidirectional parsing

## Description

Matching only a limited set with exhaustiveness checking and inversing matching function automatically.

## When to use

1. When you need to show enumerations and parse them back.
2. When the `show` function is injective (maps distinct constructors to distinct values).
3. For any bidirectional conversion by implementing only one direction and getting the inverse conversion for free.

## Benefits

1. Automatic code correctness by implementation.
2. Easier maintainability.

## Costs

1. Extra dependencies or extra code.
2. Less manual control over code.

## Usage

```haskell
import Relude.Extra.Enum (inverseMap)

data Colour
    = Green
    | Yellow
    | Blue

showColour :: Colour -> String
showColour = \case
    Green  -> "green"
    Yellow -> "yellow"
    Blue   -> "blue"

parseColour :: String -> Maybe Colour
parseColour = inverseMap showColour
```
