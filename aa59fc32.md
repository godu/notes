Z3 is a [Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories) solver developed by Microsoft

## Motivation

SAT solvers are automatic and efficient.

A primary goal of research in Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is to create verification enfines that can reason natively at a higher level of abstraction, while still retaining the speed and automation of today's Boolean engines.

## First-Order Logic

Whereas the language of SAT solvers is Boolean logic, the language of SMT solvers id first-order logic.

The language includes :
- constant $a \in S$
- function $f(x) = f(y)$
- predicate symbols $x + y < z$

A theory is a set of sentences.

A theory `T` is:
- **valid** if all sentences are true for all variable assignments.
- **satisfiable** if there exists some variables assignment such that all sentences are true.
- **unsatifiable** if all sentences are false for all variable assignments.

## Conjecture

### Definition

A conjecture is a proposition that suspected to be true but for which no proof or disproof has yet been found.

### Examples

#### [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem)

Conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 and proved in 1995 by Andrew Wiles.

There're no three positive integers `a`, `b` and `c`, can satisfy the equation

$$
a^n + b^n = c^n
$$

for any integer value of `n` greater than two.

#### [Four color theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem)

Conjectured by Francis Guthrie in 1852 and proved in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken.

> The regions of any simple planar map can be colored with only four colors, in such a waythat any two adjacent regions have different colors.

### How SMT could help ?

SMT 

```smt
(declare-const p Bool)
(declare-const q Bool)
(declare-const r Bool)
(define-fun conjecture () Bool
	(=> (and (=> p q) (=> q r))
		(=> p r)))
(assert (not conjecture))
(check-sat)
```

```haskell
import Data.SBV

_ = sat $ do
  p <- sBool "p"
  q <- sBool "q"
  r <- sBool "r"

  let conjecture = ((p .=> q) .&& (q .=> r)) .=> (p .=> r)
  constrain $ sNot conjecture
```


### NP-Completion problem

 2.15a + 2.75b + 3.35c + 3.55d + 4.20e + 5.80f = 15.05
$$

```smt
(declare-fun a () Int)

(assert (>= b 0))
(assert (>= c 0))

              (* 2.15 a)
              (* 2.75 b)
            )
            (* 3.35 c)
          )
          (* 3.55 d)
        )
        (* 4.20 e)
      )
      (* 5.80 f)
    )
    15.05
