# Instance

Instance is a representation of the [[[71620141]]] â†” data type relationships. In order to show that the data type obeys the typeclasses rules and to use the methods of the typeclass on the data values, you need to provide the work instructions under this particular typeclass. And that is the instance of the data type for the particular typeclass.
