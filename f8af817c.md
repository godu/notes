# Category

In category theory, a category is a collection of `objects` that are linked by `morphisms`. It could be represented as a directed graph.

Properties :

- Associative composition : Morphisms can be compose associatively
  - `h ∘ (g ∘ f) = (h ∘ g) ∘ f`
- Identity : For every object, there exists an identity morphism 1x
  - `1b ∘ f = f = f ∘ 1a`
